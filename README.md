# Cook It & Book It
The way to make your culinary recipes on the go.
## Why?
Let's face it cooking sites are full of unnecessary things and it's hard to fish out the actual recipes.

Then use cook books you say? A single book usually doesn't contain the selection of recipes one wants but rather the authors. They are also heavy and honestly very pricey.

That's where **Cook It & Book It** comes in! 
* It's a free application.
* Your phone is mostly with you so no need to carry any excess weight!
* Only contains the recipes you want.
* Just the recipes no long life stories that no one reads.
* Who needs paper and ink? It's a win for you and the trees as well!
* One compact recipe catalog no need for multiple sites or a book collection.
